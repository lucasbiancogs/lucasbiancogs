# Hi, I'm Lucas Bianco 👋

I'm a junior mobile developer and a mechanical engineering student fascinated by coding.

Started my graduation at UFRGS and always believed I would become an engineer with programming skils. Well, today I expect to be a developer with engineering skills.

And more about my programming carrer here, on GitHub...

### 🙋🏽‍♂️ My Projects

I choose Flutter to develope my own app from scrach. It's a group expenses controling app which I call [Group Expenses](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/groupExpenses) (I know, not a really creative name). It aims to control users own and group expenses, where you can undestand how is your family going, or your housemates, have a global picture of your expenses, who is expending money and where.

### 🎯 Flutter

My course ended with [Shop](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/shop) app, an e-commerce using Firebase. It also introduced me to Inherited Widgets and a great global state manager: Provider.

The [Meals](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/meals) app introduced me to various flutter navigations and culinaries recipies, thanks cod3r.

[Expenses](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/expenses) was the first app presented to me and it was great to understand the framework. It used a lot of adpatation between OS and phone orientation.

Since I loved what I could become, I began to search for more and found Flutter. Learning [Dart](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/dart) and how to use the framework was a really nice experience.

### 🚀 React Native

To understand users interactions the [Lambe](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/lambe) project was a greate start. It showed me how to use Firebase and how easy it could be to interact with some API's. It was also a great introduction to global state managers like Redux. 

I discovered I wanted to follow a developer carrer once I started to learn React Native and created my first mobile app called [Tasks](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/tasks), with another cod3r course. It also helped to learn more about infrastructure and backend programming with it's [backend](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/tasks-backend).

### 🐍 Python
I started coding at the first semester in college but here is where I truly got into this, learning how to code with a course from cod3r using python: [Python](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/python)
