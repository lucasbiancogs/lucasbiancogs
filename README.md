# Hi, I'm Lucas Bianco 👋

I'm a junior mobile developer and a mechanical engineering student fascinated by coding.

Started my graduation at UFRGS and always believed I would become an engineer with programming skils. Well, today I expect to be a developer with engineering skills.

And more about my programming carrer here, on GitHub...

### 🎯 Flutter



### 🚀 React Native

To understand users interactions the [Lambe](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/lambe) project was a greate start. It showed me how to use Firebase and how easy it could be to interact with some API's.

I discovered I wanted to follow a developer carrer once I started to learn React Native and created my first mobile app called [Tasks](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/tasks), with another cod3r course. It also helped to learn more about infrastructure and backend programming with it's [backend](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/tasks-backend).

### 🐍 Python
I started coding at the first semester in college but here is where I truly got into this, learning how to code with a course from cod3r, using python: [Python](https://github.com/lucasbiancogs/python)
